# Calculator
HTML calculator with basic mathematical operations

## Problems
I had to create an interactive calculator that allowed the user to type in numbers, perform basic operations, clear memory, accept decimals, prevent inappropriate input, and allow for intuitive operation

## What I used
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JS DOM manipulation

## What I learned
How to attach values to different buttons, anticipate "incorrect" input, and provide a good user experience
